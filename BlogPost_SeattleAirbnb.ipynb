Therefore, being aware of the homestay's price through seasons or even some aspects that could cause the price higher will help you have a good decision for your desired vacation.\n",

We aggregate the data to see how the price is affected by seasons and it shows that the demand rapidly increases in the first quarter, the host's availabity starts slightly dropping and the price almost reaches the top one in mid-year. The top average price and availability time are both at the end of the year. \n",

We looked at the factors that will make the price higher and it shows that 4 these main factors: Accommodates, number of bedrooms, bathrooms and beds will clearly define the range of price for rent. Once again, a suitable choice of the quantity of rooms needed can help you have a reasonable price for your vacation.\n",
