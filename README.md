### Installation
---
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
---

For this project, I was interested in using the listing activity of homestays in Seattle to figure out the answers for some questions below:

1. How does the price change by seasons?
2. What will be the factors that make the price higher?
3. Will there be an affection to the price if that homestay/apartments get more reviews?

### File Descriptions
---

There is a jupyter notebook here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is used for data exploration, data wrangling and visualization based on the related data to verify the appropriate answers for those questions.

### Results
---
The data analysis results will be demonstrated in this [Blog post](https://github.com/QuanTM26/Project1_SeattleAirbnb/blob/main/BlogPost_SeattleAirbnb.ipynb).
